# 05-Homework-ThirdPartyAPIs

For this application we are making a work day scheduler. At the top of the webpage the current date and time is listed and constantly updating. For each time block for a standard work day (9:00am-5:00pm) you can type in your scheduled event and click the save button to save it to local storage. When you refresh the page your event will save. The scheduler will also be color coded. Gray will be all past events/time-blocks. Red will be the current event/time-block. Green will be future events/time-blocks.
